This app displays a long list of every country, their capitals and their flags as provided by the [REST Country API](https://restcountries.com/#api-endpoints-v3-all)

It has a details screen where you can know more about the country such as the flags, coat of arm, the population of the country, the capital, the continent, etc.

You can as well search through the list by the country name and capital.

The Theme switching is handled with the help of a provider class in the providers directory.
This app can switch between dark and light mode.
